Demo how to use jQAssistant, Asciidoc, PlantUML, the Kontext E PlantUML jQA Plugin and arc42
to improve the architecture of Uneven Modules in the long run.

= Checking Architecture Using jQAssistant

== Traditional way

* write Cypher rules in XML
* later: write Cypher rules in Asciidoc
* latest: PlantUML is supported to some extend

== Simplest Check With Package Diagram

* packages.puml
* Packages a and b, a depends on b
* see de.kontext_e.packages.a and .b with classes A and B

== Some Styling

* make it look nicer
* extract a style file

== Brownfield: There Are Wrong Dependencies

* quick, but not so good: make the constraint not fail the check, e.g. severity=info
* better: declare dependencies that are Technical Debt
 - by a special dependency name 'technical debt'
 - by Cypher statements
 - by some kind of external configuration, e.g. XML, YAML, CSV
 - better: see below

== A Picture Is Not Enough

* adding description to the diagram
* optimal way would be to embed the diagram into the document
* Asciidoc with Diagram Plugin
* there are templates around
* best known is arc42, which comes also as Asciidoc
* fits nicely with https://docs-as-co.de[docs as code]
* Chapter 5: Building Block View

== From Packages To Components

* Packages (or namespaces, directory structures) are technical and near the code
* Raise level of abstraction
* Many terms: module, unit, subsystem, component
* Simon Brown: http://c4model.com/[C4 Model]
* Now draw components
* UML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_diagram[Component Diagram]
* Components have nices names
* Connect to code via description to the diagram
* e.g. a simple table

[options="header", architecture="components", for="demo"]
|===
| Name              | Location                                      | Purpose
| Export            | de.kontext_e.demo.export                      | Exports application data to a specified interchange format
| Report            | de.kontext_e.demo.report                      | Creates periodic and ad-hoc reports
|===

* Convention:
  - first column contains the same Component name as in the diagram (case ignored)
  - second column cointains the location of the code, e.g. package, namespace or directory name
  - more columns contain purpose and other information

== Managing Technical Debt

* in Brownfield Projects dependencies may be differ from documented or desired
* e.g. cyclic dependencies where one dependency is wanted and the other is wrong
* declaration of dependencies that are Technical Debt can be done in a table

.Unwantend Module Dependencies
[options="header", architecture="technical_debt", for="demo"]
|===
| From                          | To                            | What should be done
| Export                        | Report                        | Because there is some utility class in Report; Todo: move this utility class into Component 'Utilities'
|===

* There is even an own chapter for Risks and Technical Debt in arc42
* so TD is no longer implicit in the code, but explicitly documented at the right place in the architecture documentation

== Predefined jQAssistant Rule Set

* as long as the documentation follows some conventions, the jQAssistant Concepts and Constraints are agnostic
  to the projects
* so can be reused
* there is a Java Concepts and Constraints Compilation
* just declare it as a jQAssistant plugin, write arc42 documentation and enjoy the benefits of architecture validation
